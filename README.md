## Hiya!

### Welcome to my GitHub! I'm D. Leatti, a Dev from Brazil.

I wrote ‚Üí [HWHash](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HWHash) ‚Üê for high granularity hardware monitoring.
*It looked like no one wanted to work with ```shared memory, pointers``` and ```structs``` but overclockers like myself, kinda needed it.*

And then I built this thing ‚Üí [ŒºBiT::EYE](https://ubit.watch) ‚Üê for **MicroBT** ASICs **observability**. 
*Because apparently no one told MicroBT that 2020s UIs shouldn't look like Winamp skins, and I wanted to export my ASICs sensor data elsewhere, using Prometheus or InfluxDB.*

I've also built: SRE/observability tools, some API Hooking guides (for detours.dll), and built a couple of MMORPG bots:

I've got a backgrounds in Computer Science and Linguistics and I've worked as a L2 Support Agent, NLP/ML Consultant, DevOps/Project Manager and, of course, full stack developer, but I am, in essence, just a nerd.
