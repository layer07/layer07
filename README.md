## Hiya!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm D. Leatti, a Dev from Brazil.

PSA: This post contains:
- **0** - "disrupted the industry" claims 
- **0** - "AI-powered blockchain cloud" **buzzwords**
- **12%** - Actual usable code
- **100%** Unfiltered honesty

I wrote ‚Üí [HWHash](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HWHash) ‚Üê for high granularity hardware monitoring.
*It looked like no one wanted to work with ```shared memory, pointers``` and ```structs``` but overclockers like myself, kinda needed it.*

And then I built this thing ‚Üí [ŒºBiT::EYE](https://ubit.watch) ‚Üê for **MicroBT** ASICs **observability**. 
*Because apparently no one told MicroBT that 2020s UIs shouldn't look like Winamp skins, and I wanted to export my ASICs sensor data elsewhere, using Prometheus or InfluxDB.*

I've also built: SRE/observability tools, some API Hooking guides (for detours.dll), and even built a couple of MMORPG bots: - **Mu Online Bot:** [Reverse Engineering Mu Online Network Protocol](https://kernelriot.com/blog/reverse-engineering-mu-online-network-protocol) - **Silkroad Online Bot:** [Clientless Bot for Silkroad Online](https://kernelriot.com/blog/silkroad-online-clientless-bot) that contains hundreds of thousands of SLOC.

Almost everything that I write is either in **C** or **C#**. Personally, I prefer **Procedural or Functional** over **strict OOP**; less is more, and I honestly only care about performance, I've written enterprise code that I am not proud of, and some that I am. 

**Things I Enjoy:**

- **C** - *Nothing beats it*
- **ASM** - *I wrote PunkMark, a Benchmark tool that is full of ASM benchmarks, AVX and such* 
- **C#** - *I am a LINQ enjoyer*
- **C++** *only the parts that matter*
- **Rust** (yep)
- **Hardware** - Cache Architecture, instructions, optimizations, etc...
- **SRE** - From oldschool SysAdmin to a more *modern* name, but still
- **Datamining** - From scraping to results
- **SQLite** - Yep, im on that team
- **Postgres** - And this one too

- **Automation in general**  
  *Including extreme automation, intelligent systems, and reverse engineering strictly with the intent to automate*

I've got a backgrounds in Computer Science and Linguistics and I've worked as a L2 Support Agent, NLP/ML Consultant, DevOps/Project Manager and, of course, full stack developer, but I am, in essence, just a nerd.
